Project Title: File Organizer and Google Drive File Manager:

Overview:

The File Organizer and Google Drive File Manager is a Python application built using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). This project is designed to streamline the organization and management of files within a local directory and offers seamless file upload and download capabilities with Google Drive.

Features:

1.Automatic File Organization: 
The core functionality of this application is its ability to efficiently organize a cluttered folder containing numerous files. It accomplishes this task by categorizing files based on their extensions and creating new folders for each unique extension. Files with the same extension are then automatically moved to their respective folders, resulting in a tidy and structured directory.

2.Google Drive Integration: 
The application seamlessly integrates with Google Drive using the Google Drive API. This allows users to easily upload files from their local directory to Google Drive and download files from Google Drive to their local storage, all within the application's user-friendly interface. This integration simplifies cloud file management without the need to use a web browser.

3.File Compression: 
Users can quickly convert individual files into compressed ZIP archives with a single click, reducing file size and simplifying storage and sharing.

4.MySQL Database:
For enhanced security and user access control, the application utilizes a MySQL database to securely store user login credentials. Only authorized users with the correct password can access the GUI and perform file management operations.
